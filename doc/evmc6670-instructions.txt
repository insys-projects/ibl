Steps to use IBL on the c6670 EVM

1. Programing "IBL" on the EEPROM at bus address 0x51
   (a) Use the I2C EEPROM writer for c6670 EVM from the MCSDK distribution.
   (b) Program i2crom_0x51_c6670_le.dat (IBL image) to the EEPROM at I2C BUS 
       address 0x51 following the EEPROM writer's procedure.

2. Programing "IBL Configuration"
   NOTE: For an understanding of the IBL configuration parameters used in this step, 
         please refer to the IBL-Configuration documentation. The configuration 
         data structure is ibl_s.		 
   (a) Make sure that the boot mode dip switch is set to no boot/EMIF16 
       boot mode on the EVM (please refer to the EVM technical reference manual
	   on how to set the boot mode dip switches.
   (b) Open CCSv5 and launch the evmc66xx emulator target configuration and connect to core 0.
   (c) Load the program i2cparam_c6670_le.out to CCS.
   (d) Run the program and a message "Run the GEL for the device to be configured, 
       press return to program the I2C" will be printed on the CCS console.
   (e) Load i2cConfig.gel (in CCSv5 Tools->GEL Files, right click mouse in GEL Files
       window and select "Load GEL"
   (f) Run the GEL script "EVM c6670 IBL"->setConfig_c6670_main, this will set the 
       default boot parameters for booting application images from NOR, NAND and 
       Ethernet.
   (g) Now press "Enter" in the CCS console window, and the program will write the 
       boot parameter table to the EEPROM. On success the message "I2c table write complete" 
	   will be printed on the CCS console.

3. Programming the application on NAND or NOR flash
   NOTE: This step is not needed if the application is booted from Ethernet.
   (a) Use the NAND or NOR writer c6670 EVM from the tools directory.
   (a) Flash the Application to NAND or NOR. For instructions please follow 
       the instructions given along with the NAND/NOR writer.

4. Booting the Application using IBL
   Supported boot modes:
   IBL supports three I2C boot modes: NOR boot, NAND boot and EMAC boot. 
   Both NOR boot and NAND boot support maximum 2 images, EMAC boot supports only 1 image. 
   For all the I2C boot modes, user needs to set the boot dip switches to I2C master, bus address 0x51.

   NOR Boot:
   Set the dip switches (pin1, pin2, pin3, pin4) to: 
    SW3(off, off, on, off), 
    SW4(on, on, on, on), 
    SW5(on, on, on, off),
    SW6(on, on, on, on)
   This will set the boot para index to 0 to boot the NOR image, by default
   the boot configuration table sets the NOR offset address to be 0 and 
   image format to be ELF for image 0.
   
   NAND Boot:
   Set the dip switches (pin1, pin2, pin3, pin4) to: 
    SW3(off, off, on, off), 
    SW4(on, off, on, on), 
    SW5(on, on, on, off),
    SW6(on, on, on, on)
   This will set the boot para index to 2 to boot the NAND image, by default
   the boot configuration table sets the NAND offset address to be 16384 
   (start of block 1) and image format to be BBLOB for image 0.

   EMAC Boot:
   Set the dip switches (pin1, pin2, pin3, pin4) to: 
    SW3(off, off, on, off), 
    SW4(on, on, off, on), 
    SW5(on, on, on, off),
    SW6(on, on, on, on)
   This will set the boot para index to 4 to boot an image from a remote TFTP
   server, by default the boot configuration table sets the server IP to be 
   192.168.2.101, board IP to be 192.168.2.100 and image format to be BBLOB.
